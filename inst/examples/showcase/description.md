## Description

This app demonstrates how to save and restore the view state of a Shiny app with the help of [shinyURL](https://github.com/aoles/shinyURL).

The 'Share URL' text field above together with the two buttons below it are rendered by shinyURL. Each time you interact with the app by changing the values of the inputs or by switching between the tabs, the URL in the text field gets updated to reflect the current state of the widgets.

Your turn: try playing with the controls. Once you're ready, use the 'tinyURL' button to shorten the URL, and copy it to the clipboard with the help of the 'Copy' button. Paste the URL into a new browser tab or window to restore your settings.

You can also use the following link to load a pre-set configuration: http://tinyurl.com/shinyURL.

For details on enabling shinyURL in your app, see the package [documentation](https://github.com/aoles/shinyURL/blob/master/README.md).
